    "I wrote this notebook using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install), the go-to standard for computational notebooks. To make your life easier, I also uploaded it to a service called Google Colab. Colab is based on Jupyter, but it allows you to run this notebook without downloading or installing anything on your local machine. The code in this notebook will run in a “runtime” provided by Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside of Colab is that you need a Google account to run a notebook. If you're not logged into Google, then click on the _Sign in_ button in the upper right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you prefer, you can download this notebook and run it locally on your own Jupyter installation. Be aware that Jupyter's interface is different from Colab's–so you'll have to adapt my descriptions a bit. However, the basic idea of a notebook stays the same.)"
